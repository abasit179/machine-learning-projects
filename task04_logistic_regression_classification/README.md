# Task 4: Logistic Regression Model for Binary Classification

**Goal:**  
Implement, train, and evaluate a Logistic Regression model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic dataset.

## ðŸ”‘ Objectives

### 1. Dataset Utilization
- Use preprocessed Titanic dataset (with engineered features like Title, FamilySize)  
- Target variable: `Survived` (binary classification)  

### 2. Logistic Regression Model
- Train Logistic Regression classifier  
- Handle features/target appropriately  

### 3. Performance Metrics
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall (Sensitivity)  
- F1-score  

### 4. Diagnostics & Visualization
- Confusion Matrix (with visualization)  
- ROC Curve with AUC score
